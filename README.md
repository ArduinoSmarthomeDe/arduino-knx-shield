# Arduino Uno KNX TP-UART Shield

## Description

DIY shield for connecting the KNX bus to an Arduino Uno. Uses the first version of the Siemens TP-UART chip, which is very easy to solder by hand. In addition, there are 6 LEDs and 2 buttons on board for test purposes (e.g. for sending and receiving KNX group addresses).

The serial hardware interface (RX / TX), which is also used by the Arduino Uno from the USB port, can simply be separated from the TP-UART chip using a DIP switch. Alternatively, the serial interface of the TP-UART can be switched to software serial pins or is accessed on a connector.

*Note: This is just a DIY board, so there is no official KNX stack to configure via the ETS software.*
